/**
 * Responsible for optimizing the rate at which text is sent to the underlying API endpoint, according to the
 * specified {@link CongestionCtrl} algorithm.  {@link CongestionController} is essentially a task queue
 * that throttles the parallelism of, and delay between, task execution.
 *
 * The primary motivation for this (as of 2024/02/28) is to protect PlayHT On-Prem appliances
 * from being inundated with a burst of text-to-speech requests that it can't satisfy.  Prior to the introduction
 * of {@link CongestionController} (and more generally {@link CongestionCtrl}), the client would split
 * a text stream into two text chunks (referred to as "sentences") and send them to the API client (i.e. gRPC client)
 * simultaneously.  This would routinely overload on-prem appliances that operate without a lot of GPU capacity headroom[1].
 *
 * The result would be that most requests that clients sent would immediately result in a gRPC error 8: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED;
 * and therefore, a bad customer experience.  {@link CongestionController}, if configured with "StaticMar2024",
 * will now delay sending subsequent text chunks (i.e. sentences) to the gRPC client until audio for the preceding text
 * chunk has started streaming.
 *
 * The current {@link CongestionCtrl} algorithm ("StaticMar2024") is very simple and leaves a lot to
 * be desired.  We should iterate on these algorithms.  The {@link CongestionCtrl} enum was added so that algorithms
 * can be added without requiring customers to change their code much.
 *
 * [1] Customers tend to be very cost sensitive regarding expensive GPU capacity, and therefore want to keep their appliances
 * running near 100% utilization.
 *
 * --mtp@2024/02/28
 *
 * This class is largely inert if the specified {@link CongestionCtrl} is "Off".
